                    <span class="box">In 10 years, I envision myself as an accomplished IT developer.</span>
                    <p><span>As a recent college graduate, my main goal for the next 10 years is to learn and grow with a company, allowing me to support critical processes as I hone my skills.</span></p>
                    <p><span>Like many others I also have a goal which I need to achieve no matter how hard the situations are. Actually the goals which are close to my heart are unrealistic according to my well wishers, so I need to have a backup plan like goals. You know, unrealistic plans or dreams (according to society) are also equally important because they make you grow into a better person. They might not help you financially but after all they are our dream goals. So like all my friends I also have a realistic plan which can be achieved through hard work and dedication and will also help me to enjoy all the worldly materialistic pleasures.</span></p>
                    <p><span>In the ever-evolving landscape of technology and innovation, i envision myself thriving as an IT developer in the vibrant city of Bengaluru a decade from now. This vision not only reflects my professional aspirations but also encapsulates the dynamic spirit of a city often referred to as the Silicon Valley of India.</span></p>
                    <p><span>My primary goal is to excel in my career as an IT developer. Over the next 10 years, i see myself gaining a wealth of experience in software development, coding, and programming. Bengaluru, with its countless tech companies and startups, offers an ideal environment for honing your skills and making a meaningful impact in the IT industry.</span></p>
                    <p><span>I recognize that the world of technology is ever-changing. To stay at the forefront of my field, i plan to dedicate time and effort to continuous learning. This may involve pursuing advanced degrees or certifications, attending coding bootcamps, and keeping up with emerging technologies.</span></p>
                    <p><span>Beyond the next decade, i see myself as a respected IT professional, possibly mentoring younger talents and contributing to the tech ecosystem in Bengaluru. my may even consider entrepreneurial endeavors or innovative projects that have the potential to shape the future of technology.</span></p>
                    <p><span>My vision of becoming an IT developer in Bengaluru in 10 years is a testament to my ambition, dedication, and passion for technology. Bengaluru, with its dynamic and ever-evolving IT landscape, is the ideal canvas upon which i plan to paint my career masterpiece. My journey will be marked by continuous learning, professional growth, and a commitment to personal well-being, all while embracing the cultural richness of this thriving city. As i embark on this path, my vision serves as a guiding star toward a successful and fulfilling future in the world of IT development.</span></p>
                    <p><span>In my personal life I want to upgrade myself in a way that I have no grudges or competition with others. I want to concentrate on making myself a strong willed and calm person who is not affected by the actions of others. I know I have some leadership qualities also, so will also groom myself in a way that my good qualities are enhanced. I want to become a role model for my juniors, siblings and co- workers. I want to be successful in life because my parents are proud of me and I can give them a comfortable and happy life. But starting working doesn't mean that I will forget myself but I will devote some time to the unfulfilled secret goals that I wanted to achieve.</span></p>
                    <p><span>After 10 years I see myself with some good qualifications (degree), working in a reputed institution, spending time with family and doing something for my society and mother nature. Over the next few years I will try to fulfill all my plans with all my strength. I will not leave any opportunity which proves to be a hallway to the completion of my goals. I will try my best to be a valuable and irreplaceable asset for the institution I work for. As any other youngster I also want to change happiness and success for myself as well as for my parents and siblings.</span></p>
